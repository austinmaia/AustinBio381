>The Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), also known as the estuarine dolphin or costero, is a dolphin found in the coastal waters to the north and east of South America, and east of Central America. It is a member of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae). It can live in both saltwater and freshwater

Here's a block of plain text!

```{r}
#Here's a block of R code
x <- 3
y <- "The number 3"

```



Use the `plot()` function to plot a graph.

$y = mx + b$

| Type of Pet | Number Allowed | Pet deposit |
| :---------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Cats        | 2              | $100        |
| Dogs        | 1              | $150        |

I prefer ==cats== as pets because they're less work, but I do like ==dogs==!
